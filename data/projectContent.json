Part of my assignment was to plan and implement a hackathon event.</p><p>On the day of the event, staff drove 45 youth from Club sites across the city to the Northeast Portland Boys & Girls Club. I recruited and trained 14 skilled volunteers who led small teams through the process of brainstorming, wireframing, and programming an Android app. We served two hearty meals, held a project fair, and provided our youth with certificates and resources on continuing with computer science. </p>",
